TECHNICAL DETAILS

2.8" diagonal color touchscreen TFT

240x320 resolution, 18-bit (262,000) color - our library uses 16 bit color mode

ILI9341 (datasheet) controller with built in video RAM buffer

STMPE610 touch screen controller

High speed SPI display with digital SPI touchscreen driver

The display uses digital pins 13-9. Touchscreen controller requires digital pin 8.
microSD pin requires digital #4.
That means you can use digital pins 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and analog 0-5.
Pin 4 is available if not using the microSD.

Works with any classic Arduino '328.
Solder closed three jumpers to use the ICSP header for use with Leonardo or Mega
Onboard 3.3V @ 300mA LDO regulator, current draw depends on usage but is about
100mA for the display and touchscreen 4 white LED backlight.
On by default but you can connect the transistor to a digital pin for backlight
